# Smogon to Serebii Dex Availability Checker

A very simple implementation of Python's BeautifulSoup library to check what's available in a smogon tier of any generation in a regional pokedex that's in a particular Serebii page. As an example, this is useful for those who want to start an NU-only Pokemons in a Pokemon game. For now, it's only been tested for Serebii's HGSS and BW dex site. However, it should be fully functional for any Smogon tier / generation.

There is no interface yet, and it needs a code interpreter to edit to change the desired generation / link to analyze. This is due to this being my first ever coding project.
